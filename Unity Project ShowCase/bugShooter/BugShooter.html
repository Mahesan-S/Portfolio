            “Bug Shooter” is my first 3D game and represents a major step
            forward in my journey as a game developer. In this project, I
            explored many exciting Unity features and learned how to build a
            complete gameplay experience in three dimensions.

        <p class="Para">
          I implemented player controls, shooting mechanics, and enemy AI
          behavior to create an engaging and interactive 3D environment. Along
          the way, I experimented with particle effects, lighting, materials,
          and camera movement to enhance the overall visual quality and feel of
          the game. I also learned how to design realistic terrains, sculpting
          landscapes and adding trees and environmental details to make the
          world more immersive. Additionally, I implemented a teleportation
          system to enable smooth 3D transitions within the level, adding more
          depth to gameplay. To refine the visuals further, I applied
          post-processing effects such as bloom, color grading, and ambient
          occlusion, giving the game a more polished and cinematic look. For the
          art style, I used cartoon-themed assets for both the player and
          enemies, giving the world a fun, stylized personality. Developing Bug
          Shooter helped me gain a deeper understanding of 3D game development,
          optimization, and Unity’s powerful tools — making it a key milestone
          in my learning journey.

          In my 2D game Escape the Traps, I created a complete Animator
          Controller using Unity’s animation state machine system. The player’s
          animations — such as idle, walk, jump, and death — are managed through
          different animation states connected by transitions. These states are
          controlled through code, where specific key inputs trigger animation
          changes. For example, pressing movement keys activates the walk
          animation, jumping triggers the jump state, and when the player hits a
          trap, the death animation plays automatically. This setup ensures
          smooth and responsive character movement while keeping the gameplay
          immersive and visually dynamic.

        <p class="Para">
          In my 2D game Escape the Traps, I designed the full map layout to
          provide a clear and engaging gameplay flow. I used a Cinemachine
          camera to create smooth and dynamic camera movements that follow the
          player naturally throughout the level. To enhance the experience, I
          implemented an Audio Source component for sound effects, adding impact
          to actions like jumping, triggering traps, and reaching checkpoints.
          Additionally, I used the Canvas system in Unity to display UI elements
          such as markers and indicators, helping players navigate and
          understand objectives within the game world. This combination of
          visuals, audio, and smooth camera control makes the gameplay feel more
          polished and immersive.
