            <h1>engineering model</h1>
            <p>
                Designed and developed multiple VR-based educational 
                applications for engineering students using the Unity Engine. 
                Implemented over four interactive 3D projects featuring real-time simulations, 
                physics-based interactions, optimized C# scripting, and immersive VR controls to 
                enhance hands-on learning and conceptual understanding.

            <h1>Musiem model</h1>
            <p>
                Developed a museum project for the Porunai Museum in Tirunelveli using Unreal Engine. 
                Worked with both C++ and Blueprints. Integrated Arduino hardware to capture real bellows press
                 and release actions, synchronizing character movements accordingly. 
                Implemented drag-and-drop interactions to trigger animations.”

            <h1>AI ChatBot model</h1>
            <p>
                Developed an AI Chatbot using Python and Unreal Engine, where Python processes input data and
                 generates relevant responses. Integrated the system with Unreal Engine MetaHuman characters, 
                enabling real-time speech output with synchronized lip-sync animations.
