            “Escape The Traps” is my first 2D game and marks the beginning of my
            journey into game development. In this project, I experimented with
            fundamental game design concepts, including data structures,
            animation effects, and tile-based background systems. Developing
            this game helped me understand the core mechanics of 2D gameplay,
            such as player control, enemy interactions, and level design. It was
            a great learning experience that strengthened my foundation in
            programming and creative game development.

        <p class="Para">
          Escape the Traps is a thrilling 2D platformer featuring smooth
          character animation, dynamic particle effects, and thoughtfully placed
          traps and checkpoints. Players progress through three increasingly
          challenging levels; when you die you respawn at the last checkpoint,
          so every run tests your timing and strategy without feeling unfair.
          The final level delivers an intense, memorable challenge with clever
          trap designs and a dramatic progression. Doors and teleporters are
          integrated into the world — some doors open automatically while others
          require the player to press a button to move objects or activate
          mechanisms. With responsive controls, clear visual feedback from
          particles and animations, and carefully balanced checkpoints, Escape
          the Traps offers a satisfying mix of precision platforming and
          puzzle-like interactions.

          In my 2D game Escape the Traps, I created a complete Animator
          Controller using Unity’s animation state machine system. The player’s
          animations — such as idle, walk, jump, and death — are managed through
          different animation states connected by transitions. These states are
          controlled through code, where specific key inputs trigger animation
          changes. For example, pressing movement keys activates the walk
          animation, jumping triggers the jump state, and when the player hits a
          trap, the death animation plays automatically. This setup ensures
          smooth and responsive character movement while keeping the gameplay
          immersive and visually dynamic.

          In my 2D game Escape the Traps, I designed the full map layout to
          provide a clear and engaging gameplay flow. I used a Cinemachine
          camera to create smooth and dynamic camera movements that follow the
          player naturally throughout the level. To enhance the experience, I
          implemented an Audio Source component for sound effects, adding impact
          to actions like jumping, triggering traps, and reaching checkpoints.
          Additionally, I used the Canvas system in Unity to display UI elements
          such as markers and indicators, helping players navigate and
          understand objectives within the game world. This combination of
          visuals, audio, and smooth camera control makes the gameplay feel more
          polished and immersive.
