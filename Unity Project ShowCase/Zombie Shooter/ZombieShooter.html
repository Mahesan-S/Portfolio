            “Zombie Shooter” is my second 3D game and builds on the systems I
            developed in Bug Shooter. It features improved AI, particle effects,
            and animation states, along with new additions like audio effects,
            timeline-based cutscenes, and Unity’s animation rigging system for
            realistic character motion. This project helped me enhance my
            technical skills and learn how to blend gameplay with cinematic
            storytelling.

        <p class="Para">
          In this project, I focused on leveraging my knowledge of Unity’s
          Animation Rigging System to create realistic and dynamic character
          movements. I applied advanced rigging techniques, including Multi-Aim
          and IK constraints, to ensure precise weapon handling and natural
          whole-body motion. The project allowed me to experiment with layered
          animations, smooth blending between locomotion and combat actions, and
          runtime IK adjustments for hands and weapons. Working on Zombie
          Shooter gave me valuable experience in building complex rigs,
          fine-tuning character motion, and integrating animation systems
          seamlessly with gameplay, significantly enhancing both visual polish
          and player immersion.

        <p class="Para">
          This is the animation state machine I created in Unity to control my
          character’s actions and transitions. It manages different animation
          states such as idle, walking, picking up items, pulling levers, and
          dying. Each state is connected through conditional transitions
          controlled by parameters like States, PickUp, RunPick, FireState, Aim,
          and Pull. These parameters are triggered through gameplay inputs and
          events, allowing smooth transitions and realistic motion between
          actions. For example, when the player moves, the character shifts from
          idle to running; when interacting with objects, it transitions to a
          pickup or lever-pulling animation. This system provides a clear,
          modular structure that makes it easy to expand and refine animations
          while keeping movement natural and responsive within the game.

        <h1 class="heading show">Animation Layer</h1>
        <h1></h1>
        <p class="Para">
          I implemented a two-layer animation system to handle different aspects
          of character movement and combat. The first layer manages locomotion,
          blending walk and run animations smoothly based on player input to
          ensure natural movement transitions. The second layer is dedicated to
          combat actions, including aiming, shooting, firing, and reloading. By
          separating these layers, the character can perform upper-body actions
          like aiming or firing a weapon independently of lower-body movement,
          allowing the player to run, strafe, or walk while simultaneously
          performing combat animations. The system also uses weight blending and
          layer masking to ensure smooth transitions between idle, movement, and
          action states, resulting in responsive and visually coherent gameplay.

          I implemented a full rigging system in Unity using the Animation
          Rigging package to create realistic, goal-oriented character motion.
          Multi-Aim and chained constraints drive the shoulders, hips, and head
          to produce natural, whole-body aiming, while secondary adjustments
          like shoulder offsets, aim smoothing, and rotation limits prevent
          unnatural poses. Additive rotation constraints with damped
          interpolation make spins and sweeping motions feel powerful yet
          readable. The rig supports multiple weapons with configurable target
          sockets and per-weapon offsets, integrates with the Animator
          Controller and gameplay events, and includes runtime visualization
          tools for fine-tuning. Performance is optimized by limiting
          constraints and using lerped weights.

        <p class="Para">
          To handle hand and weapon alignment, I created an IK animation script
          that activates at runtime when a weapon is equipped. The script snaps
          hands to the weapon’s grip sockets smoothly, blending with
          animator-driven motion for firing, reloading, and movement animations.
          Input events toggle rig layers and IK weights, enabling smooth
          transitions between armed and unarmed states. Overall, this system
          ensures believable aiming, reliable hand placement, and natural,
          polished character motion while maintaining performance.

          I created a cutscene in which zombies enter the scene dynamically when
          a gate opens. The cutscene coordinates animations, camera angles, and
          timing so that the gate opening triggers a dramatic reveal of the
          zombies, building tension and anticipation for the player. During this
          sequence, the zombies move along predefined paths or spawn at specific
          points to create a cinematic and immersive experience. The system
          ensures smooth transitions between the cutscene and gameplay, allowing
          the player to seamlessly take control once the zombies are fully
          engaged, while also supporting adjustments for timing, wave size, and
          entry points to enhance suspense and replayability.
